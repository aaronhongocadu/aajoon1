    The two articles clearly raise the problem of commercialization and monopolization. It is argued that digital users, especially graphic designers, 
    need to reduce their dependence on Adobe and Apple due to the autonomy of software and hardware. The view is that the definition of the term 'graphic designing' 
    itself is turning into the 'using of Adobe and Apple's products', and argues that a solution should be sought immediately so that digital world/industries can be used more healthily and diversely.

Usually, people think highly of software dependence when they think of 'designers', but in fact, they are more aware of the importance of hardware as one of the 'designers'. 
Because of the connectivity between software and hardware, it is natural that designing something requires both, and hardware most likely exists for software, 
but new hardware is much more important than people think for the designers at this time when some multiple designer software requires high-end hardware. 
Even if it is not due to environmental issues, I think recyclable resources are becoming increasingly essential for the designers in the industries, and the objects they design are naturally turing into recycling-friendly.

    I wanted to make sure that this application is just for sharing each other's recipes of Cup Noodles so I tried to remove all the feature that can disturpt the purpose of the app.
After trying some uploaded recipes by the other, they can rate the dish and
write some reviews which could also lead to a development of the recipes.

   1. The universal user Lualinas defines is the users who understand what they want or how they achieve something from the Internet and have the ability to recreate such a specific space. Lualinas argument also encourages the creation of websites with their particular purpose, and I think this supports Schwulst's argument for avoiding the use of specific platforms and advocating the use of each website. Both arguments also strongly recommend the use of individual websites or secured software for ordinary users who cannot distinguish between impure or negative content on the Internet or platform. Creating a website using any certified software such as Visual Code Studio can be an example. I think a person who has the ability to build his or her own space with the desired direction and tendency by directly entering the code is also a universal user.
    
    
2. I'm currently in the process of becoming a 'Universal user' since I don't want to be a general user, so I'm studying how to design and plan my own space such as creating a website or a new application, and I'm a little critical of the active use of social media. Like Lunalinas's argument, I seems to want to establish my own live website to inform or share my status with others and communicate in a space tailored to my own direction while NOT using Twitter or Instagram.
